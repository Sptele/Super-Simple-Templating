# Super-Simple-Templating
A tiny, customizable string templater for JS. (This is a for fun project, since it already exists in javascript/typescript)

## Issues trying to use TypeScript
I wanted to learn TypeScript using this. However, just by trying to use the implementation of modules on the TS website, I ran into a bunch of errors that were *still* not solved. After 10 minutes of no solutions, I gave up because TypeScript seems not to be ready enough to be easily switched in, instead of JS.
